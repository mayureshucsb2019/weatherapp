REST API
Weather Checker

Please create a REST API that displays the weather info at the visitor’s requested location - By City.

The expected GET will be
http://localhost:3000/weather?city=London

You can use OpenWeatherMap.org as source of data and will require to create a Free API Key

The main weather API require Longitude and Latitude based location while our API will expect City Name from the end user
Eg.: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
Source: https://openweathermap.org/current

The following API can be used to convert City Name into Longitude and Latitude
Eg.: http://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=London&limit=5&appid={API key}

Source: https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api



Requirements:
1. The API request to get the weather from openweathermap.org should be made from the API server.
2. No unit or functional tests will be expected.
3. You may use any 3rd party libraries that you wish.
4. Please include a README with brief documentation on your solution, including chosen technology and any important tradeoffs you made.
5. You could use any language of your choosing, bonus points for Go :)

This project is expected to take a couple hours at most, so if it looks longer than that, please send me questions and I’ll be happy to clarify!

Please feel free to turn this back to me by Friday morning, the sooner the better however.
